# Baby's First GAN

_(and also first Python project and also first Jupyter notebook)_  
From a [tutorial](https://medium.com/ai-society/gans-from-scratch-1-a-deep-introduction-with-code-in-pytorch-and-tensorflow-cb03cdcdba0f) written by [Diego Gomez](http://github.com/diegoalejogm). Check it out!

## Notes

This is pretty much just a step-by-step recreation without any riffs or anything cool like that (and even some obvious copy-and-pasting!). Over the next few days, I'll go through line-by-line and try to grok out some of what's happening.

A bug in the dataset loader has been found in more recent implementations since the tutorial was first published. See this [comment/thread](https://github.com/fungtion/DANN/issues/8#issuecomment-569011702) for details.
